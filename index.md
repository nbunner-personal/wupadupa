Wupadupa as a collective is currently in hiatus with everyone busy with families and working on their own projects. We'll still post the odd update about those individual projects from time to time, but this site is now mainly an archive of some of the fun stuff we put on over the years. 

Some of the artists still release their music using the Wupadupa name as the name of their record label. Check them out on the [artists page](/artists.html)

<h2>Cake</h2>
<p>Cake is a very important thing.</p>
<p>We believe people should eat more cake so we usually provide free cake at our events, Yay!</p> 
<p>Many of our past events have raised money and awareness for charities, including Friends of the Earth, the Sudan Appeal and Amnesty International.</p>
